    "### Creating an App\n",
    "\n",
    "To access Reddit API you need to create an app on Reddit (it requires having a regular account first). It might sound a bit difficult at first but it is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to [www.reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com) and create an account if you do not have one. \n",
    "2. When you are logged in to Reddit go to this [link](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps). After pressing `Create app` you should see something like below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"../png/reddit_app.png\"/></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, you should be interested in only three fields: `name`, `type of the app`, and `redirect_url`. You should fill in these fields as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `name` -- the name of your app. It should be one word.\n",
    "* `type of the app` -- you should select script. \n",
    "* `redirect url` -- the location where the authorization server sends the user once the app has been successfully authorized and granted an authorization code or access token. You should type the following: `http://localhost:8080`. It will make sure that after successful authorization you will stay on Reddit API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Press `Create app`. Congratulations, you just have created your first app!\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now see something like the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"../png/reddit_app2.png\"/></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the picture above we hid some information because those are the credentials (authorization details) you will use to tell Reddit API who you are. You should never share them with anyone, even your spouse or a firefighter! That is because they serve to identify you. If someone maluses them it will be on you. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Storing credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways to store your credentials and passwords safely. We do not want them to be corrupted, right? However, it is one thing to store them safely and the other to have strong passwords. We all know that we should use strong passwords, but do we really know why? The picture below shows how fast one can crack your password depending on its complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"../png/password_table_2023.jpg\"/></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyhow, the lesson we should take from the graph above is twofold:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use strong passwords.\n",
    "2. Use password managers to propose strong passwords and store them.\n",
    "\n",
    "If for any reason, you are still reluctant to trust password managers at least create complex passwords by mixing nonsense words (it is the only place where making spelling errors helps) and special characters, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    ">`$eating#keyborads-1ncreases_staminA`\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we have already generated passwords and credentials which look pretty strong. How are we going to store them?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environmental variables\n",
    "\n",
    "As you probably rightly suspect, in our case, we will need our credentials to connect to API. We do not really want to store them in the notebook because we want to be able to share the notebook. We do not want to copy and paste them every time we want to use the notebook cause it would be very inefficient. Also, it will be quite easy to forget about it. What are we going to do then?\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use something which is called environmental variables. In other words, we are going to define some variables either on our computer or in the Colab that will be stored there. In the Notebook, we will just retrieve them by their names. For this purpose, we need to press the key on the left-hand side tab. We need to define the 5 variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `username` -- our Reddit's username.\n",
    "2. `password` -- our password to Reddit.\n",
    "3. `client_id` -- it is a string right below the name of our app.\n",
    "4. `client_secret` -- it is a string called secret.\n",
    "5. `user_agent` -- `<name of OS>:<client_id>:<version of the app> (r/<username)`, in my case it is `macos:<client_id>:v1 (r/profesor_floretu)`"

    "\n",
    "In this study, we looked for relevant posts from the subreddits r/Portugal, r/UK, and r/Polska. Our search keywords within these subreddits were \"vegan\", “vegetarian”, “plant-based diet”, “meat reduction” and “flexitarian”. The criteria for choosing the post were (1) the date of creation (around 2021), (2) the number of comments, (3) the relevance of the content, and (4) encouragement to share motivations and barriers, for instance, questions containing a call to actions to explain the reasons for choosing specific diet (e.g., ‘What is your diet? Share why you chose it’). The relevance of the content was assessed based on the quality of the comments shared. The comments were considered relevant if they contained meaningful arguments and responses, rather than being surface-level remarks (e.g. \"I like meat.\") that did not contribute to the subject of the post. Our data collection encompassed all available comments (i.e., responses to other users' posts) posted on the chosen submission. \n",
    "\n",
    "We first identified the submission through the user interface and only then we used the following script to collect all the comments under the given post.
